# RoboND-UnitySim
Prototype project for Robotics NanoDegree  
Provides a simulation of a quad drone for controls and deep learning exercises

The project features two main environments ('scenes') to experiment with:
1. quad_indoor: a giant box sized 300mÂ³, with a 1m tiling grid covering all sides.
2. proto4: an outdoor city environment
The city scene starts with a menu to choose between controlling the quad for the Controls and Deep Learning projects, and setting up to train the neural network for the Deep Learning project. In the training mode, a human character will spawn in a random place with a random appearance, and a camera follows the person around to record.

### Examples ###

To publish an upward thrust of 0.1, use this format:
```
$ rostopic pub /quad_rotor/cmd_force geometry_msgs/Wrench "force:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.1
torque:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0"
```
_Note: if gravity is on, a force that small won't lift the quad off the ground_  

To turn on gravity, use the following:  
`$ rosservice call /quad_rotor/gravity "data: true"`


# Controlling the Quad and Camera
1. `F12`: toggle local control on/off
2. `WSAD (arrow keys)`: Move around
3. `Space/C`: Thrust up/down
4. `Q/E`: Turn around
5. `Scroll wheel`: zoom in/out
6. `RMB (hold & drag)`: Rotate camera
7. `RMB (click)`: Reset camera
8. `G`: Gravity on/off
9. `R`: Reset quad orientation
10. `1-4`: Switch camera views (Front/side/top/Iso)
11. `P`: Plot waypoint
12. `O`: Begin following current path
13. `I`: Clear all waypoints
14. `L`: Toggle this info on/off
15. `Esc`: Quit

# Capturing images for deep learning (city only):
1. Fire up the executable with the city environment. Select `DL Training` from the menu
2. To begin recording, press `R` to bring up the dialog and choose where to save the recording. Select or create a convenient folder, such as in your Desktop or Documents, and confirm, and recording begins.
3. Images are captured from two cameras - one that sees the environment as you do, and one that sees in black&white as shown at the bottom right. The images are captured once every 3 seconds or so.
4. To stop recording, press `R` again, or simply close the executable (`Esc`)
