# RoboND-UnitySim
Prototype project for Robotics NanoDegree

This project ..something, something.. quad drone controls and deep learning exercise

<br>The project features two main environments ('scenes') to experiment with:
1. quad_indoor: a giant box sized 300mÂ³, with a 1m tiling grid covering all sides.
2. proto4: an outdoor city environment

Controlling the quad locally:
1. To enable local control, press F12 or click the "Input off" button on-screen. Doing so again will disable control
2. The drone has a simplified local control script that allows the user to quickly and easily move around as if it was a game character.
3. Use WSAD or the arrow keys to move the quad forward, back, left, or right
4. Use Space and C to move the quad up and down
5. Q and E will yaw the quad

Capturing images for deep learning (proto4):
<br>//Todo: add instructions to for manual and auto capturing

Ros commands available locally:
1. F8: change camera distance (random distance between 2-20m selected at the moment)
2. Keys 1-5: change camera view - front, side, top, iso, free (uses iso at the moment)
3. R: reset quad's orientation
