# RoboND-UnitySim
Prototype project for Robotics NanoDegree

This project ..something, something.. quad drone controls and deep learning exercise
The project features two main environments ('scenes') to experiment with:
1. quad_indoor: a giant box sized 300mÂ³, with a 1m tiling grid covering all sides.
2. proto4: an outdoor city environment

Controlling the quad locally:
<br>-To enable local control, press F12 or click the "Input off" button on-screen. Doing so again will disable control
<br>-The drone has a simplified local control script that allows the user to quickly and easily move around as if it was a game character.
-Use WSAD or the arrow keys to move the quad forward, back, left, or right
-Use Space and C to move the quad up and down
-Q and E will yaw the quad

Capturing images for deep learning:
//Todo: add instructions to for manual and auto capturing
